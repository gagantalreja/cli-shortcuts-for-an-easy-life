# CLI Shortcuts That Make Your Life Easier

The cli shortcuts given in this repo can be used to make the life of a devops engineer easy. You can copy whatever commands are useful for you and add them to your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc` file.  In case, you do not want to copy individual commands and instead use all the configured aliases or functions, copy the following line in your `~/.zshrc` or `~/.bashrc` and source 

```shell
source <local-path-to-this-github-repo>/cli-shortcuts/*.sh
```

Run `source ~/.zshrc` or `source ~/.bashrc` once you have added the commands to your file to start using them.
